- Installed and customized ComfyUI on local machine (Windows/Linux).
- Built modular workflows for:
  - Text-to-Image
  - Inpainting / Outpainting
  - Prompt-controlled Variants
- Used SDXL + LoRA models.
- Exported workflows for use in API automation.

**Tools:** ComfyUI, SDXL, LoRA, PNGInfo

### 3. AUTOMATIC1111 Web UI
- Ran Stable Diffusion using A1111 WebUI.
- Enabled extensions:
  - ControlNet
  - DreamBooth
  - Tiled Diffusion
- Used Prompt Travel & Batch Plotting.

**Tools:** A1111, ControlNet, DreamBooth

---

### 4. Third-Party APIs
- DALL·E 3 for ultra-detailed text-to-image.
- RunwayML & Replicate API for quick testing with pre-trained models.
- Used NightCafe, Leonardo.AI for GPU-free concepts.

**Tools:** DALL·E, RunwayML, Replicate API, Mage.Space

## 🎥 Video Generation – Tools & Workflow

### 1. Deforum + Stable Diffusion (Local)
- Animated scenes using Deforum with Stable Diffusion.
- Controlled motion with keyframes and interpolation.
- Assembled clips with FFMPEG.

**Tools:** Deforum, A1111, FFMPEG

---

### 2. RunwayML
- Used Gen-2 to generate videos from prompts and static images.
- Added motion brush, background animation, face edits.

**Tools:** RunwayML Gen-2, Motion Brush

---

### 3. Pika Labs & Kaiber
- Pika Labs for stylized storytelling.
- Kaiber.ai to animate stills and sync to music/narration.

**Tools:** Pika Labs, Kaiber

---

### 4. TTS + Music + Video Editors
- Voice: Tortoise TTS, ElevenLabs
- Music: AIVA, Soundraw
- Assembly: Adobe Premiere, CapCut, Descript

---

## 🔁 Integration Pipeline

```bash
Prompt -> ComfyUI/Fooocus/SDXL -> Image
Image + TTS/Music -> Deforum/Runway -> Video
Final Video -> Edited with CapCut / Descript / Premiere
```
