# creative-AI-projects / # 🚀 AI-Creative Suite – Generative AI Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my personal GitHub showcase of AI-driven generative projects. This repository highlights my work in the domain of **Generative AI**, where I explored advanced techniques like **LoRA training**, **ComfyUI workflows**, **Stable Diffusion models**, and **API-based image/video generation**.

---

## 🌟 Projects Highlights

### 📚 1. AI-Generated Story Worlds
- Built a system that creates **interactive, illustrated stories** using AI.
- Stories are generated based on user input, themes, or mood (e.g., Sci-fi, Romance, Horror).
- **Tools Used:** GPT-based text generation, SDXL/ComfyUI for visuals.
- **Features:**
  - Dynamic plot generation
  - AI-generated illustrations for each scene
  - Option to export stories as EPUB/PDF
- **Demo:** `/stories/ai-fables-illustrated/`

---

### 🧠 2. LoRA Training Suite
- Trained multiple **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** models using custom datasets.
- Topics: **Historical figures**, **Fictional characters**, **Fantasy objects**, **Personalized avatars**.
- Integrated into **ComfyUI pipelines** for fast inference and fine-tuning.
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch, Diffusers, DreamBooth

---

### 🧰 3. ComfyUI Automation System
- Developed reusable and modular ComfyUI workflows for:
  - Text-to-image
  - Image-to-image refinement
  - AI-inpainting for story visuals
- Exported workflows as deployable pipelines for local & server usage.
- Created a GUI on top using **Tkinter** for batch automation.

---

### 🌐 4. RESTful API for Generative AI Services
- Designed and deployed Flask/FastAPI servers that:
  - Accept prompts via API
  - Trigger AI workflows (image/story/video)
  - Return media output in JSON
- Used in real-time preview tools and dashboards.
- **Endpoints:**
  - `/generate-image`
  - `/create-story`
  - `/inference-video`

---

### 🖼️ 5. AI Image Generator (Stable Diffusion + Fooocus)
- Integrated **Stable Diffusion (SDXL)** and **Fooocus** in a local environment.
- Enabled creative controls: style, tone, concept art, character merging.
- Developed a web frontend to allow prompt-based live generation.
- Added prompt templates for:
  - Sci-fi concepts
  - Realistic human portraits
  - Abstract emotions

---

### 🎥 6. AI Video Generator
- Generated short clips from storyboards using **animated diffusion models**.
- Added voiceover (TTS), background music, and motion templates.
- Projects:
  - *AI Fairytales with Music*
  - *Sci-Fi Shorts with Synthesized Narration*
- Also experimented with **Runway ML API** and **local deforum pipelines**.
