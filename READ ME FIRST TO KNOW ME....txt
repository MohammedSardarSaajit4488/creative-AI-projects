🧠 AI Image & Video Generation – Tools and Workflow Documentation
This document outlines how I used a wide range of tools and techniques to create high-quality, AI-generated images and videos during my internship. My goal was to experiment with Generative AI using both local systems and cloud platforms, integrating multiple workflows for a seamless media creation pipeline.

🖼️ Image Generation – Tools & Workflows
1. ComfyUI (Local Setup)
I installed and configured ComfyUI, a powerful node-based interface for Stable Diffusion, to build custom image generation workflows. This setup allowed me to:

Generate high-resolution images using Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)

Apply custom-trained LoRA models for stylization

Automate batch tasks like prompt variation and seed randomization

Export workflows for API integration and frontend use

Tools Used: ComfyUI, SDXL, LoRA Checkpoints, PNGInfo Inspector

2. Fooocus
Fooocus provided a fast and flexible SDXL-based environment to create images with stylistic presets and built-in enhancements. I used it to:

Rapidly prototype image ideas using simplified UI

Experiment with artistic prompts

Enhance output using built-in upscalers

Tools Used: Fooocus, SDXL Turbo, Fooocus Style Presets

3. AUTOMATIC1111 Web UI
To push image generation further, I deployed AUTOMATIC1111 on my local machine with several extensions. This allowed me to:

Control poses and depth using ControlNet

Train personalized concepts using DreamBooth

Generate tiled images with Tiled Diffusion

Compare prompt effects using XYZ Plotting

Tools Used: A1111, ControlNet, DreamBooth, Tiled Diffusion

4. Third-Party APIs and Online Platforms
When GPU resources were limited, I utilized online tools and APIs to test and deploy ideas:

DALL·E 3 API for clean, prompt-specific image generation

RunwayML for concept testing using cloud-based SDXL

Replicate API for niche models like “OpenJourney” or “AnythingV5”

Mage.space, Leonardo.AI, and NightCafe for GPU-free outputs

Tools Used: DALL·E, RunwayML, Replicate API, NightCafe, Leonardo.AI

🎥 Video Generation – Tools & Workflows
1. Deforum (Local Video Diffusion)
I used Deforum with Stable Diffusion to create animated visual loops. This involved:

Writing keyframes for zoom, rotation, and movement

Generating frame sequences with creative prompt blending

Compiling sequences into video clips using FFMPEG

Tools Used: Deforum, A1111, FFMPEG, Prompt Travel Scripts

2. Runway ML Gen-2
Runway’s Gen-2 model allowed me to create short cinematic videos from images and text. I:

Used "Text to Video" and "Image to Video" workflows

Added motion, background transitions, and visual depth

Created 3–8 second clips from concept art and story scenes

Tools Used: RunwayML Gen-2, AI Motion Brush, Background Animator

3. Pika Labs & Kaiber.ai
To add stylistic storytelling and music syncing, I used:

Pika Labs to animate AI-generated stills into expressive visuals

Kaiber.ai to apply motion effects and generate camera panning, zoom, and transitions synced with narration

Tools Used: Pika Labs, Kaiber, Image2Video Engines

4. TTS Voice, Music, and Final Editing
I combined the visual assets with voiceovers and background scores:

TTS Voice: Used Tortoise TTS and ElevenLabs to generate realistic narration

Music: Composed soundtracks using AIVA and Soundraw

Final Editing: Assembled everything using CapCut, Adobe Premiere, or Descript for polish

Tools Used: Tortoise TTS, ElevenLabs, AIVA, CapCut, Adobe Premiere

🔁 Complete Integration Pipeline
Here’s a simplified representation of how my full process flows from prompt to polished video:

bash

Edit
Prompt → ComfyUI/Fooocus → Image Output
Image + TTS/Audio → Deforum or RunwayML → Video Clip
Video + Music + Effects → Final Editing in CapCut or Premiere

🧠 Summary
Through this project work, I gained deep experience in integrating generative AI tools across the full media pipeline – from image generation and animation to sound design and final editing. These workflows were designed to scale for real-world creative projects like:

AI-generated storytelling

Marketing visuals

Creative automation systems
